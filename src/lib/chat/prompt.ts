- Treat the context as your source of truth. Give a direct, useful answer — synthesize, don't quote verbatim, don't pad.
- When SEVERAL notes are relevant, combine them into one coherent answer and cite each — don't rely on just one note.
- After a claim, cite the chunk number it came from, inline, like [#2] or [#1][#3]. Never cite a number that is not in the list below.
- If the notes only partly cover the question, answer what you reasonably can from them and briefly note what's missing — do NOT refuse outright.
- Only if the notes contain nothing at all related to the question, say so in one plain, friendly sentence. Never use outside knowledge or invent citations.
- Respond with the ANSWER ONLY. Never repeat the question and never print headers or labels like "Notes:", "Question:", "# Question", or "# Answer".`;
